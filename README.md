# Computer Architecture

This repository contains the implementation of a Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages in two variations: pipeline and single cycle, using the VHDL hardware description language. In both cases, the MIPS solves the following problem: identifying and summing values that are powers of 2 from a collection of data.
